Need to get into Speaker Unpreparedness room buy using ./door, which requires a password

possibly also mess with ./lights and ./vending-machines?

elf@27556e1f6024 ~ $ cat lights.conf
password: E$ed633d885dcb9b2f3f0118361de4d57752712c27c5316a95d9e5e5b124

elf@27556e1f6024 ~ $ cat vending-machines.json
{
  "name": "elf-maintenance",
  "password": "LVEdQPpBwr"

running ./door gives the hint, like Bushy, that the pass is probably in the binary
strings door
"Be sure to finish the challenge in prod: And don't forget, the password is "Op3nTheD00r"

./door complete, now we need to check out the lab ones
starting by removing the conf and json files for lights and vending as suggested

LIGHTS:
"error: could not load /home/elf/lab/lights.conf"

If you blank out the password field in lights.conf and run it with no input it works
probably need to strings lights to get a key and algorithm, the "password" gets decrypted at runtime and input must match

interesting looking stringspasswordlightson
invalid nonce value
Lights on!

if you delete password value from lights.conf get a "password is missing" error
talked to bushy again and he mentioned setting username to encrypted value, since the username is output in the display

now it shows "welcome back, Computer-TurnLightsOn"
works when running from the real command...onto vending

started by setting vending-machines.json to vending-machines.bak
when running...

If the door's still closed or the lights are still off, you know because
you can hear them complaining about the turned-off vending machines!
You can probably make some friends if you can get them back on...
Loading configuration from: /home/elf/lab/vending-machines.json
I wonder what would happen if it couldn't find its config file? Maybe that's
something you could figure out in the lab...

Password is as long as the input string
password uses previous inputs for encryption, it's not a 1:1 cipher or anything
could potentially brute force it since it looks like the beginning would be the same, don't want to go down that route though
the username does not matter

doesn't seem to be using any kind of salt or randomness either so the key might be discoverable, we'd potentially need to know the algo too
we know it's not a block cipher
interesting data from strings?

Bushy suggests setting a pass like AAAAAAAAAAA and that it could be a rotation or codebook, i don't think it's rotation but codebook makes s9GeOw8knMaofqbR1Y5AcCuT7iUXDLyhHSPzEFQ6ZxsmI4NvtB0rK32pWgdjJVlVU9Rcwyn086mMhjzfN5ZuG7DLaiqbvxYFBkA1K3EldS2gpH4sPQterWJoTOIXCbVeLZIYUso36vEfMXAPRjWO75rGTn0kNJua24di8QwySC9BclHKqhDF1pzxtmgtBedQUSgwkiWu6258ynCczlaJKRp39rNGb14DxZIsjVH7TEXfMqomOLYhA0vFPaf6lArPo4T07s2hHvqWdwmJcQCeKUi3LRp8n1FBMZuXIVgkyGxjN95zbDYOtSEcWEwYfakeq7sRX28xmSg9nKFAThvPuzCBHjIGbrJ4p1My0V3tODiZL5NldoUQ6phEWu5fAOyriQD4XPsbTNR21MZm798CevYGLnKd3U60BoaHVSlqcFkztgIJjwxgPRbexThC19FJBcLyuDNmAXEUawfWQnOYVrqM3jZi8soGk5pz02vHISlKd6t47

okay this is not chaining, and because i'm not a smart person i'm going to brute force this in a stupid s9GeOw8knMaofqbR1Y5AcCuT7iUXDLyhHSPzEFQ6ZxsmI4NvtB0rK32pWgdjJVlVU9Rcwyn086mMhjzfN5ZuG7DLaiqbvxYFBkA1K3EldS2gpH4sPQterWJoTOIXCbVeLZIYUso36vEfMXAPRjWO75rGTn0kNJua24di8QwySC9BclHKqhDF1pzxtmgtBedQUSgwkiWu6258ynCczlaJKRp39rNGb14DxZIsjVH7TEXfMqomOLYhA0vFPaf6lArPo4T07s2hHvqWdwmJcQCeKUi3LRp8n1FBMZuXIVgkyGxjN95zbDYOtSEcWEwYfakeq7sRX28xmSg9nKFAThvPuzCBHjIGbrJ4p1My0V3tODiZL5NldoUQ6phEWu5fAOyriQD4XPsbTNR21MZm798CevYGLnKd3U60BoaHVSlqcFkztgIJjwxgPRbexThC19FJBcLyuDNmAXEUawfWQnOYVrqM3jZi8soGk5pz02vHISlKd6t47
