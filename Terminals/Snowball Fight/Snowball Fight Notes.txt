Tangle Coalbox:
This version seems simple enough on the Easy level, but the Impossible level is, well...
I'd call it impossible, but I just saw someone beat it! I'm sure something's off here.
Could it be that the name a player provides has some connection to how the forts are laid out?
Knowing that, I can see how an elf might feed their Hard name into an Easy game to cheat a bit.
But on Impossible, the best you get are rejected player names in the page comments. Can you use those somehow?
