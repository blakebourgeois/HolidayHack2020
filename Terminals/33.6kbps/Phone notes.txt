This isn't a terminal per se but I don't want to create an even more complicated folder structure

Fitzy says the number is 756-8347
also provides the dial up noise: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Dial_up_modem_noises.ogg

The phone provides the following "sound effects"

beDURRdunditty
SCHHRRHHRTHRTR
aaah
baaDEEbrrr
WEWEWweweewee

I'm guessing I've got to make the sequence of the dial up sound so...

baaDEEbrrr > aaah > WEWEWwrwrrwrr > beDURRdunditty > SCHHRRHHRTHRTR
