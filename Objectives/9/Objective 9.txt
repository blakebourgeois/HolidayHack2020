Objective:
Go to the NetWars room on the roof and help Alabaster Snowball get access back to a host using ARP. 
Retrieve the document at /NORTH_POLE_Land_Use_Board_Meeting_Minutes.txt. 
Who recused herself from the vote described on the document?

Context from Alabaster:
"Oh, I see the Scapy Present Packet Prepper has already been completed!

Now you can help me get access to this machine.

It seems that some interloper here at the North Pole has taken control of the host.

We need to regain access to some important documents associated with Kringle Castle.

Maybe we should try a machine-in-the-middle attack?

That could give us access to manipulate DNS responses.

But we'll still need to cook up something to change the HTTP response."

Opening the terminal gives this:
Jack Frost has hijacked the host at 10.6.6.35 with some custom malware.
Help the North Pole by getting command line access back to this host.

Read the HELP.md file for information to help you in this endeavor.

Note: The terminal lifetime expires after 30 or more minutes so be 
sure to copy off any essential work you have done as you go.

there's a TMUX session open with 3 panels

Hints:
Jack Frost must have gotten malware on our host at 10.6.6.35 
because we can no longer access it. 
Try sniffing the eth0 interface using tcpdump -nni eth0 
to see if you can view any traffic from that host.

The host is performing an ARP request. 
Perhaps we could do a spoof to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack. 
I think we have some sample scapy traffic scripts that could help you in 
/home/guest/scripts.

Hmmm, looks like the host does a DNS request after 
you successfully do an ARP spoof. Let's return a DNS response 
resolving the request to our IP.

The malware on the host does an HTTP request for a .deb package. 
Maybe we can get command line access by sending it a command in a customized .deb file

# How To Resize and Switch Terminal Panes:
You can use the key combinations ( Ctrl+B ↑ or ↓ ) to resize the terminals.
You can use the key combinations ( Ctrl+B o ) to switch terminal panes.

# To Add An Additional Terminal Pane:
`/usr/bin/tmux split-window -hb`

# To exit a terminal pane simply type:
`exit`

# To Launch a webserver to serve-up files/folder in a local directory:
```
cd /my/directory/with/files

Have to keep the tcpdump running while running the my_arp.py script to get the intercepted request.
Would probably want to get that my_arp.py running in a continuous manner. 

The intercepted DNS request is as follows:
17:42:51.190188 IP 10.6.6.35.9252 > 10.6.6.53.53: 0+ A? ftp.osuosl.org. (32)

After spoofing the DNS and pointing to our own IP the following activity is seen
19:17:40.028669 IP 10.6.6.35.3926 > 10.6.6.53.53: 0+ A? ftp.osuosl.org. (32)
19:17:40.057397 IP 10.6.6.53.53 > 10.6.6.35.3926: 0 1/0/0 A 10.6.0.2 (62)

OK,TS val 2149560333 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0

running a python webserver during this shows this request

netcat victim

name the resulting work.deb "suriv_amd64.deb"

create structure for /pub/jfrost/backdoor/
move suriv_amd64.deb to that folder and initate

(make sure your local IP hasn't changed, came back from a disconnect and assumed it was same and my shell didn't catch)
