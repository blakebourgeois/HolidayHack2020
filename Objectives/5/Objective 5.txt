Open HID lock in the workshop.

Talk to Bushy Evergreen and Fitzy Shortstack for hints

Need to get to the workshop on floor 1 1/2 requiring red and green lights

By moving the nut on the elevator panel to the middle of the stream, i can split the original green stream into to and add the red bulb to the left stream, which turns it red. then we're able to proceed to workshop

Picked up a proxmark back in the wrapping room
"You can use a Proxmark to capture the facility code and ID value of HID ProxCard badge by running lf hid read when you are close enough to someone with a badge."
You can also use a Proxmark to impersonate a badge to unlock a door, if the badge you impersonate has access. lf hid sim -r 2006......

guess I'll watch the Larry Pesce talk

Data Format
Card returns facility code and card ID
Facility code is 1-255
Card ID is 1-65535

encoded in Weigand protocol 26-bit data format
Parity Bit, 8 bits for Facility code, 16 bits for Card ID, Parity Bit

lf hid read
gets data

lf hid sim -r {raw}
use a captured card

lf hid clone {raw} to clone them (may not be useful, don't know if we'd grab writable t5557 RFID in this exercise)

cards will typically all share a facility code
and their card numbers are typically issued sequentially as well
it's possible that earlier cards have higher access

lf hid sim -w H10301 --fc 118 --cn 16612
simulate facility code and card ID w/o having to set wiegand value

lf hid sim -w H10301 --fc 113 --cn 6020 (nothing)
missing 6021...why is 6040 such an outlier? 

going talk to fitzy shortstack since i skipped that challenge. might give more info that trying each number in sequence and waiting 10 seconds
Fizty says that Shinny is trusted by Santa

lf hid sim -w H10301 --fc 113 --cn 6025
Door opens!

From this dark room you can control Santa. I believe there were some places that required Santa or other authorized elves...but I can't remember what they were
