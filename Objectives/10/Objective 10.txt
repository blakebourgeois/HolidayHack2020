Objective: Bypass the Santavator fingerprint sensor. Enter Santa's office without Santa's fingerprint.

don't know if this is relevant, might want to check URL as not-santa

elf in lobby says there "may be a way to bypass the s4 stream"
would this also bypass fingerprint?

My guess is this is some console trickery, going to go back and do elf code terminal, see if Ribb Bonbowford has hints
all he says is "may be a way to bypass Santavator S4 game with browser console"
so that might not be helpful?

from the console changed the iframe content to "besanta" which allowed me in after the bulbs were properly in place
