11A: Even though the chunk of the blockchain that you have ends with block 129996, 
can you predict the nonce for block 130000? 
Talk to Tangle Coalbox in the Speaker UNpreparedness Room for tips on prediction 
and Tinsel Upatree for more tips and tools. (Enter just the 32-characters hex hash)
Answer:

11B: The SHA256 of Jack's altered block is: 
58a3b9335a6ceb0234c12d35a0564c4e 
f0e90152d0eb2ce2082383b38028a90f. 
If you're clever, you can recreate the original version of that block 
by changing the values of only 4 bytes. 
Once you've recreated the original block, what is the SHA256 of that block?
