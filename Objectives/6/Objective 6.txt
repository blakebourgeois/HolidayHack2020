Took Santa to the Great Room to check out splunk

I feel this wasn't available without Santa? I can't remember

Q1: How many distinct MITRE ATT&CK techniques did Alice emulate?		
Alice's first command: | tstats count where index=* by index 
manually counted the distinct technique categories
Answer: 13

Q2: What are the names of the two indexes that contain the results of emulating Enterprise ATT&CK technique 1059.003? (Put them in alphabetical order and separate them with a space)
Alice shares this snippet:
| tstats count where index=* by index 
| search index=T*-win OR T*-main
| rex field=index "(?<technique>t\d+)[\.\-].0*" 
| stats dc(technique)

looked through the results from the first search for t1059.003
Answer: t1059.003-main t1059.003-win


Q3: One technique that Santa had us simulate deals with 'system information discovery'. What is the full name of the registry key that is queried to determine the MachineGuid?
corresponds to this: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/
alice shares this resource: https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/tree/master/atomics 
info we need is here: https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1082/T1082.yaml

Answer: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography

Q4: According to events recorded by the Splunk Attack Range, when was the first OSTAP related atomic test executed? (Please provide the alphanumeric UTC timestamp.)
alice provides the following index for looking at attacks: index=attack

index=attack AND OSTAP | sort _time
Answer: 2020-11-30T17:44:15Z

Q5: One Atomic Red Team test executed by the Attack Range makes use of an open source package authored by frgnca on GitHub. According to Sysmon (Event Code 1) events in Splunk, what was the ProcessId associated with the first use of this component?
frgnca wrote some cmdlets for audio controls
index=attack "Test Name"="using device audio capture commandlet"

first hit: 2020-11-30T17:05:11Z
11/30/20 5:05:11.000 PM

index=T1123 source="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
index=T1123* source="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventID=1 CommandLine=*AudioDevice*

Answer: 3648

Q6: Alice ran a simulation of an attacker abusing Windows registry run keys. This technique leveraged a multi-line batch file that was also used by a few other techniques. What is the final command of this multi-line batch file used as part of this simulation?
https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/
https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/

might be batstartup.bat or Discovery.bat?

index=T1547*

https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/ARTifacts/Misc/Discovery.bat

A: quser

Q7: According to x509 certificate events captured by Zeek (formerly Bro), what is the serial number of the TLS certificate assigned to the Windows domain controller in the attack range?

alice provides... index=* sourcetype=bro* 
used fields navigator on the left to drill down to this query:
index=* sourcetype=bro* sourcetype="bro:x509:json" "certificate.subject"="CN=win-dc-748.attackrange.local"

then found the certificate.serial field

A: 55FCEEBB21270D9249E86F4B9DC7AA60

Encrypted using Santa's favorite phrase
B64 encoded cipher text: 7FXjP1lyfKbyDK/MChyf36h7
uses old algo w/ key ("we don't care about RFC 7565!")
"splunk folks put it in their talk" > Stay Frosty (?)

Cyberchef
7FXjP1lyfKbyDK/MChyf36h7 > from Base64 > RC w/ Passphrase "Stay Frosty"
output: The Lollipop Guild

Q: What is the name of the adversary group that Santa feared would attack KringleCon?
The Lollipop Guild
