Need to run the Santavator
To do so I've picked up several items laying around in the overworld
(can't list all what and where, though)

In my santavator panel I have access to 
* a nut
* a candy cane bit
* a green bulb

The green bulb can change the color of the light stream
I can use the nut to reflect the light into the green slot with a bow on it
This gives me a "green" power light which...should give me access to the lobby and talks.
I'll need to find a red light (with santa hat) and a yellow? light (with cristmas tree) to access more floors

And this is everything for objective 4...
